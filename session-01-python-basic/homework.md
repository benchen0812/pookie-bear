In this session, teacher Pookie Bear went through some built-in data types in Python. <br>
Here is the list of the types Pookie Bear walked us through during the session: <br>

- Boolean
- Numeric Types: int, float
- Sequence Types: list, tuple
- Text Sequence Type: str
- Set Types: set, frozenset

## Exercise 1

To review and practice what we have learned, please complete the following exercises. <br>

1. Select a built-in data type.
2. Create at least one variable of the selected data type.
3. Call at least one method of the selected data type.
4. Repeat step 1 to 3 for two more different built-in data types.

### Example

```python
# Selected data type: str
# method called: isdigit

a = "3"
b = "three"
print(a.isdigit()) # True
print(b.isdigit()) # False
```

## Exercise 2

Look up the documentation for the methods you called in Exercise 1.<br>
Can you briefly explain what the methods do?

## Exercise 3

Prepare to explain your code in Exercise 1 during the next session.
